i-love-you
==========

``i-love-u`` is a tiny program that generates a lovely digital valentine's
day card. It is aesthetically inspired by `ythecombinator`_'s
`happy-valentines`_, but with a twist -- it can draw an ASCII heart with the
name of your beloved one.

Motivation
----------

I wrote this as some sort of gift to a person I love and care very much. It's
kinda silly, but... isn't all the love letters a bit silly too? Don't think too
much, just enjoy the date.
